# pyTorch-cpp-Tutorials
A project made to Learn pytorch on cpp


I was trying to debug this to understand the working of pytorch but I was unable to find the required src files anyways I made a few tutorials for referance soo...

to run any tutorial do the following :

1. go to the directory of the tutorial 

2. create a build directory and change directory to 'build'
```bash
mkdir build
cd build 
```
3. type the below command & replace the folder to the path of pytorch installation. (for installation refer below)

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/download/of/libtorch ..
```
4. make it
```bash
make
```

5. run the target file using ./file
